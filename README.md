# duckgooglecaptcha

An userscript redirects your search to DuckDuckGo when Google makes you do a CAPTCHA because your IP is "sending too many requests" 

Some people just get assigned an IP like this and it can be very annoying to have to do a captcha every time you want to google something
This script minimizes that annoyance by redirecting your search to DuckDuckGo

# Installation
Simply install it using your favorite userscript extension (e.g Violentmonkey Tampermonkey Greasemonkey...)
